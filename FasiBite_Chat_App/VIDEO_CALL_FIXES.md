# Video Call Disconnection Issue Fixes

## Problem Description
The video call was connecting successfully but disconnecting automatically after about 8 seconds. This was happening because of improper cleanup in the LiveKit room connection management.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `VideoCallInterface.tsx` component where the `useEffect` hook for managing the LiveKit room connection was causing unintended disconnections:

1. The cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook was disconnecting the room even when it shouldn't
2. There was no proper check to ensure the room being disconnected was the current room
3. The component was not properly handling the room lifecycle

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. VideoCallInterface.tsx
- Improved room connection management with proper checks
- Added validation to ensure cleanup only affects the current room
- Fixed the dependency array handling to prevent unnecessary reconnections
- Enhanced error handling and state management

### 2. VideoCallProvider.tsx
- Added isMountedRef checks to prevent state updates on unmounted components
- Improved connection/disconnection logic
- Enhanced error handling for all SignalR events

### 3. VideoCallInterfaceWrapper.tsx
- Simplified the rendering logic
- Improved error handling in the endCall function

## Technical Details

### VideoCallInterface.tsx Changes
The main fix was in the cleanup function of the `useEffect` hook that manages the LiveKit room:

```typescript
// Before: Always disconnected the room
return () => {
    newRoom.off(RoomEvent.Connected, handleConnected);
    newRoom.off(RoomEvent.Disconnected, handleDisconnected);
    // ... other event listeners
    newRoom.disconnect(); // This was causing the issue
};

// After: Only disconnect if it's still the current room
return () => {
    // Remove event listeners
    newRoom.off(RoomEvent.Connected, handleConnected);
    newRoom.off(RoomEvent.Disconnected, handleDisconnected);
    // ... other event listeners

    // Only disconnect if this is still the current room and it's connected
    if (roomRef.current === newRoom && newRoom.state !== 'disconnected') {
        console.log("[VideoCallInterface] Disconnecting room on cleanup");
        newRoom.disconnect();
    }
    
    // Only reset roomRef if it's the same room
    if (roomRef.current === newRoom) {
        roomRef.current = null;
    }
};
```

### VideoCallProvider.tsx Changes
Added proper isMountedRef checks to prevent state updates on unmounted components:

```typescript
// Added checks like this throughout the component:
if (!isMountedRef.current) return;

// And in the cleanup function:
return () => {
    isMountedRef.current = false;
    if (timeoutId) {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }
    disconnectRef.current?.();
};
```

## Testing
After implementing these fixes, the video call should:
1. Connect successfully
2. Stay connected for the duration of the call
3. Properly disconnect only when the user ends the call or when legitimately disconnected by the server
4. Handle component unmounting without causing errors

## Additional Improvements
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Improved error handling and user notifications
- Better state management for room connections
