# Video Call System Improvements

## Overview
This document explains the improvements made to the 1-on-1 video call system to address disconnection issues and improve stability.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Token Synchronization
**Problem**: When User A calls User B, both users need proper LiveKit tokens to join the same room. The previous implementation had issues with token handling and synchronization.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified the token flow in `VideoCallProvider`
- Ensured both caller and callee receive proper LiveKit credentials
- Removed complex navigation logic that was causing token mismatches

### 2. Room Connection Management
**Problem**: The VideoCallInterface component was creating new Room instances unnecessarily and not properly handling reconnections.

**Solution**:
- Added proper room instance management with `roomRef`
- Implemented connection state tracking (`isConnecting`, `isConnected`)
- Added proper cleanup logic to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. State Management
**Problem**: Inconsistencies in how the video call state was managed between the VideoCallProvider and the VideoCallInterface.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the VideoCallInterfaceWrapper to use data directly from VideoCallProvider
- Removed URL-based props that were causing confusion
- Centralized state management in the VideoCallProvider

### 4. Cleanup and Disconnection Handling
**Problem**: The cleanup logic when disconnecting or ending calls wasn't robust enough, leading to unexpected disconnections.

**Solution**:
- Added proper room disconnection logic in cleanup functions
- Implemented event handlers for connection lifecycle events
- Added proper track attachment/detachment logic

## Key Components

### VideoCallProvider
- Centralized state management for video calls
- Handles SignalR connection and event handling
- Manages call lifecycle (start, accept, decline, end)
- Stores session data with LiveKit credentials

### VideoCallInterfaceWrapper
- Simplified wrapper that connects to VideoCallProvider
- Renders the VideoCallInterface when there's an active call
- Handles user data and call state

### VideoCallInterface
- Main video call UI component
- Manages LiveKit room connection
- Handles camera/microphone toggling
- Displays video streams for local and remote participants

## Connection Flow

1. **Caller (User A)**:
   - Calls `startCall` in VideoCallProvider
   - Receives session data with LiveKit token
   - Waits for callee to accept

2. **Callee (User B)**:
   - Receives incoming call notification
   - Calls `acceptCall` in VideoCallProvider
   - Receives session data with LiveKit token
   - Both users join the same LiveKit room

3. **Both Users**:
   - Connect to LiveKit room using provided credentials
   - Enable camera and microphone by default
   - Display video streams

## Stability Improvements

1. **Proper Room Management**:
   - Only one room instance per call
   - Proper cleanup on disconnection
   - Reconnection handling

2. **Device Toggle Improvements**:
   - Use `mute/unmute` instead of `enable/disable` to prevent reconnections
   - Proper track management
   - State synchronization

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Graceful error recovery
   - User notifications for connection issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test call initiation and acceptance
2. Verify both users can see each other's video
3. Test microphone/camera toggling during calls
4. Test call ending from both sides
5. Test reconnection scenarios
6. Test with different network conditions

## Future Improvements

1. Add screen sharing functionality
2. Implement chat during calls
3. Add call quality indicators
4. Implement call recording features
5. Add call statistics display
